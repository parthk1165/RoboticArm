# RoboticArm
## Introduction 
This project is a part of my third year mini project. Our Group developed a robotic arm that is cost effective and versatile for various industrial applications. The robotic arm is capable of performing tasks such as pick-and-place, assembly, material handling, sorting, and more. It has a modular structure that is lightweight, durable, and has 3 degrees of freedom. It also has a web interface that allows the user to control the robotic arm remotely and record and play back sequences of steps.

## Components
The main components of the project are:

+ Esp32: A microcontroller that communicates with the web interface and controls the servo motors.
+ Servo motors: Motors that provide precise and repeatable motion for the joints of the robotic arm.
+ Power supply: A custom power supply that provides sufficient voltage and current for the Esp32 and the servo motors.
+ 3D printed robotic arm: A 3D printed structure that consists of several parts that form the base, the shoulder, the elbow, and the gripper of the robotic arm. The 3D printed files were taken from an open source project ( https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1454048 )
